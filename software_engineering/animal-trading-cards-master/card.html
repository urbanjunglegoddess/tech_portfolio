			<p>Amur leopards have a pale coat with widely spaced rosettes and thick unbroken rings. They are well-adapted to the cold northern climate with longer fur that can grow up to 7 cm in winter for insulation. They weigh 70-105 pounds. </p>
				<p>These solitary big cats are skilled hunters and climbers. They prey mainly on deer like sika and roe deer, as well as wild boar, hares, and other small mammals. Amur leopards can run at speeds up to 37 mph and leap over 19 feet. They mark large territories of 19-116 square miles.</p> 

<p>In summary, the Amur leopard is a critically endangered subspecies found only in the Russian Far East and adjacent China, but its population has increased in recent years due to intensive conservation efforts.</p>
